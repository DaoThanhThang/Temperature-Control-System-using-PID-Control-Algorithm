# Temperature Control System
Descripton: The Temperature Control System with PID Algorithm project involves the development of a precise temperature control system utilizing the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm. The system is implemented using C/C++ for microcontroller programming and Altium for hardware design. Additionally, an Android application is integrated for USB-based control. The primary objective is to achieve accurate temperature regulation through closed-loop control systems, sensor interfacing, and embedded actuator control.
